# Zue

## What is this?

Zue is a simple MVVM tool, which derives from Vue. It aims to help everyone to understand the principles of Vue in a more simpler way.

## To start

Now, it only supports `{{}}` replacement, which I will continually add the features to it.

## Build Setup

``` bash
npm install

npm start

```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
